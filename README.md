## Features
* Calculate Schockley Queisser efficiency limit and related parameters for a given bandgap, temperature and solar spectrum
* Plot SQ limit J-V curve for a given bandgap of the solar cell
* Plot power conversion efficiency, fill factor, current density, and open-circuit voltage as a function of different bandgaps
* Can export calculated PCE, Voc, FF, Jsc for an array of bandgaps (new in v1.0.1)
